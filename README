This is a skeleton code for MSS course SGX challenge.
Before compiling clone the Linux SGX SDK repository into ../linux-sgx, or
modify buildenv.mk to point to the right location.
Build and install Linux SGX SDK to /opt/intel/sgxsdk, or modify
task-1(2)-2018/Makefile to point to the right location.

Task 1.
Instructions are on MyCourses, and the files contain TODO items.
Start with implementing the enclave, then with the help of utils
functions create it and call it.

Task 2.
Install boost_system and boost_program_options for your Linux distribution.
Run make in libs/lib_la.
After the library is built implement the necessary enclave functions.
Similarly to task-1 invoke the enclave from the main program.
